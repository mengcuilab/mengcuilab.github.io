		<h4> For a long time, the advancements of computing and acquisition 
		hardware and algorithm have driven the transformative progress of 
		imaging technology. Take bioimaging as an example, the maturation 
		of low-noise high-QE scientific cameras and the wide availability 
		of computing power make super-resolution microscopy techniques possible; 
		the development of high-throughput electron microscopy and machine 
		learning based image processing enables large scale mapping of the 
		wiring of brains. Despite these successes, the developments of image 
		processing algorithms and imaging systems have been mostly running 
		on parallel tracks. In other words, the image processing research was 
		based on the acquired data from the available imaging systems and the 
		imaging system development simply aims to return the best quality data 
		as quickly as possible. A far more efficient approach is to merge the 
		best technologies from both disciplines and design the imaging system 
		with the image processing algorithm embedded, returning meaningful output 
		effectively instead of merely producing large amount of data. </h4>
