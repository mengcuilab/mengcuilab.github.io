	  For a long time, the advancements of computing and acquisition 
	  hardware and algorithm have driven the transformative progress of 
	  imaging technology. Take bioimaging as an example, the maturation 
	  of low-noise high-QE scientific cameras and the wide availability 
	  of computing power make super-resolution microscopy techniques possible; 
	  the development of high-throughput electron microscopy and machine 
	  learning based image processing enables large scale mapping of the 
	  wiring of brains. Despite these successes, the developments of image 
	  processing algorithms and imaging systems have been mostly running 
	  on parallel tracks. In other words, the image processing research was 
	  based on the acquired data from the available imaging systems and the 
	  imaging system development simply aims to return the best quality data 
	  as quickly as possible. A far more efficient approach is to merge the 
	  best technologies from both disciplines and design the imaging system 
	  with the image processing algorithm embedded, returning meaningful output 
	  effectively instead of merely producing large amount of data. </h4>
