			<p> For engineering, my goal is to solve important problems which matters to our world. 
			  The essence of research is to explore the unknown and discover the hidden secret and eventually 
			  lead to 10x, 100x, or even 1000x improvement over the established technology. Information 
			  technology has profoundly transformed our world. New ideas are quickly spread over the globe. 
			  Very often, we witness the convergence instead of singularity in science and technology. 
			  Convergence is not all bad, which leads to broad adoption or successive improvement of key 
			  inventions. However, singularity (the discovery of a new route, the birth of a new method, 
			  the transition from 0 to 1) should be the main focus of research, which is what our lab 
			  aspires to accomplish.

			<h2> Whole Mammalian Brain Neurophotonic Interface </h2>
			<p>  The rapid advances of genetic indicators and actuators have enabled high spatiotemporal 
			  resolution recording and modulation of brain functions. However, they all rely on using 
			  light to form optical focus inside brain tissue. Even with the advance of imaging technology 
			  and laser sources, the access depth remains superficial. Our lab is working on a new invention 
			  which is aimed to achieve whole mammalian brain neurophotonic interface.
			  The application is not only to address to the key problems of studying mammalian brain but 
			  also to provide a new route for brain computer interface. </p>

			<h2> High-Throughput High-Resolution 4D Imaging </h2>
			<p> To understand systems as complex as mammalian brain, one needs the capability of recording 
			  from huge population of neurons at kHz volume rate. We are working to develop a powerful and 
			  flexible high-through high-resolution system to achieve this goal. </p>

			<h2> Ultra-Low Light Videography </h2>
			<p> Recording images and videos at the extremely low illumination dosage has broad applications 
			  across medicine and biology. Leveraging the advance of computational image processing and the 
			  physics of single photon level video recording, we are working to develop technology that 
			  allows high-quality video recording with photon flux less than 1 photon/pixel. </p>
